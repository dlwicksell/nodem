# This is just an example script to get started, if you don't already have a
# YottaDB/GT.M environment configured.
#
# *** NOTE ***
# This environment script will only work if you are running the BASH shell
#
# In order to use this environment script, you would typically add a line to
# your ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile login script, to source it in your current
# environment, e.g.
#
#     source $HOME/node_modules/nodem/resources/environ
#
# You want to make sure that path is correct, based on where you installed Nodem
# on your system. No matter where you installed it, the following environment
# variables should be set up correctly, without change, to be able to use it.
#
# You also need to have the $gtm_dist environment variable set correctly, in
# order to compile, link, and use Nodem. You also need the $gtmgbldir
# environment variable set correctly, pointing to your global directory file, in
# order to connect to the YottaDB/GT.M database with Nodem APIs. The following
# environment variables are also needed; $GTMCI points to the call-in table, and
# $gtmroutines must contain the path to the v4wNode.m source file, or v4wNode.o
# object file.
#
# Since $gtm_dist needs to correctly point to your YottaDB/GT.M installation
# root directory, in order to compile Nodem in the first place, you likely will
# not need to set up LD_LIBRARY_PATH, as the path in $gtm_dist is embedded as a
# RUNPATH directly in the Nodem library, so the dynamic linker should be able to
# load the YottaDB/GT.M shared library at runtime without having to set it.
# However, if you compile Nodem in one environment, and want to run it in a
# different environment, which has YottaDB or GT.M installed in a different
# location, you will need to either set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the distribution
# root, or else add that directory to the ldcache, as discussed in the README.md
# file.

export GTMCI="$DIR/resources/nodem.ci"
# GT.M routines path

# Runtime loader path for GT.M shared library, if necessary (see README.md)
#export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${gtm_dist}:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
